# Rename file Tool

This is a program to rename files. To use it, just run $ python rename.py and pass two arguments, the first is the old name (full path if it is not in the same directory as the program) of the file you want to rename and the second argument is the new name (again, full path for files in different directories). Ex:

```
$ python rename.py <old_file_name.txt> <new_file_name.txt>
```
